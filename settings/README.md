# Attributes
The label "sneakers-converse-yellow" is a combination of the object name and attribute names.
- '-' is used as a separator so that '-' in the object name and the attribute name is replaced with '\_'.
- If any objects are not using attributes, '-' in the object name is not replaced with '\_'.
- The prefix is used such as '-' + prefix + attribute name.
- Attribute types are "Single select", "Multiple select", and "Text input".
- You can assign 0-9 number keys, A-Z alphabet keys, and modifier flags such as command, control, and shift keys to attribute names.
- Right click on the attributes table header, "Sort alphabetically" menu appears.
