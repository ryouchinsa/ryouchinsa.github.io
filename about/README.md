# About team
Hi, I'm [Ryo Kawamura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rectlabel2017), an independent full-stack engineer from Tokyo, Japan. I'm very dedicated about building tools that are simple and intuitive for developers and saving their time and money that they can spend on things they love.

In 2017, I released the first version of RectLabel, which over the years has become the go-to image annotation tool for macOS users and cited by their [papers](https://rectlabel.com/papers). I've invested thousands and thousands of hours to [support users](https://github.com/ryouchinsa/Rectlabel-support), gradually shaping RectLabel into what it is today: one of the simplest solutions to annotate images for object detection and segmentation.

I will develop the macOS open source version, Windows version, and Ubuntu version.
