# Pricing

[The standard RectLabel](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1210181730) offers subscription plans, $2,99/month and $9.99/year.

[RectLabel Pro](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1490990105) offers a one-time payment plan, $19.99/one-time.

RectLabel Pro is for a long time use and different from the standard RectLabel for 2 points.
- The license can be bought by one-time payment. And the license corresponds to volume purchases.
- There are no network connections because there are no in-app purchases.

Both apps can use all features.
