# Pricing

[The standard RectLabel](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1210181730) offers subscription plans, $2,99/month and $9.99/year.

The standard RectLabel has a free trial period, and although the trial is untimed, a license must be purchased for continued use.

[RectLabel Pro](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1490990105) offers a one-time payment plan, $19.99/one-time.

RectLabel Pro is for a long time use and different from the standard RectLabel for 2 points.
- The license can be bought by one-time payment and corresponds to volume purchases.
- There are no network connections because there are no in-app purchases.

For larger deployments, we highly recommend assigning app licenses directly to a device rather than an Apple ID, which eliminates the need for individual IDs. App licenses are purchased through the [Apple Business Manager](https://business.apple.com/) as 'Managed' licenses (not redemption codes).

Both apps can use all features.
